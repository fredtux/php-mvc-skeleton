Just use ```docker-compose up``` and you're ready to code

# Example
In order to understand how the autoload works, just follow the example for the main page, it goes through all the required steps.

# Naming
Use the namespace ```myproject``` or change it to your own.

Files will be named using this convention:
1. Controller -> ```NameCotroller```
2. Model -> ```NameModel```
3. View -> ```NameView```

The view will load a page from ```public/html```

# Paths
All paths are defined in ```config.php```
